# Kulinerin-CC22-PC392

Human lifestyles often change habits and traditions in behavior. This is also inseparable when viewed from the side of consuming food. Food which is considered a form of identity for a nation does not rule out the possibility of experiencing a shift in values for existing humans. This is quite disturbing, it can cause the loss of the identity of a nation. Seen the phenomenon of the number of young people who prefer non-traditional food to participate in shifting the position of traditional food.
The presence of traditional food is increasingly threatened because no generation knows recipes and food ingredients. KULINERIN application is a solution that can overcome the problem of cultural crisis. Various regional food catalogs contain recipes and food ingredients, and some features can detect what types of food ingredients and what types of traditional foods.

The application that we want to make is an application that provides information about spices in detail, both in the form of information and what they are used for. By implementing Image recognition, you only need to point the camera at the object, that is, all the information will appear. The application that will be made is based on Android because it follows developments where everything that exists uses a smartphone. KULINERIN is a solution that can overcome the problem of the cultural crisis, where many people do not know traditional food recipes and recognize the types of kitchen spices.

Planned Execution :
We wanted to make it easier for people to search for Indonesian traditional food recipes and this app can also identify the ingredients according to the recipe by capturing on your smartphone camera. You can also save a list of your favorite recipes in the app.

Conclusion :
We hope this project will act as a starting point for future works to bring convenience to Indonesian citizens, especially people who do not know specific ingredients for Indonesian traditional food recipes.
